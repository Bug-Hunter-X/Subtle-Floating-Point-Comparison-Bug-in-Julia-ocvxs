This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Julia related to floating-point comparisons. The `myfunction` function aims to square positive numbers and negate negative numbers. However, due to floating-point precision, very small negative numbers close to zero may be incorrectly treated as positive. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version that addresses this using a tolerance for comparison.  The bug is common when dealing with numerical computations and comparisons involving floating-point data in Julia and other programming languages.
